# Bundling Static files


*Introducing Webpack to the Project*
```
>>>Download Node/npm
>>> npm init (creates package.json)
>>>npm install webpack --save-dev (will save as dev dependecies)
>>>make two js files script1.js  and script2.js
```

*script1.js*
```
var messsge = require('< path to script2.js >')
alert(message)
```

*script2.js*
```
module.exports = "tempus fugus"
```

then on commandline run 
```
>>> webpack script1.js ./bundle.js
>>> this will combine the code of two file and put it into one file

and you'll see it by name of bundle.js and it will work as same as both the js files
```
